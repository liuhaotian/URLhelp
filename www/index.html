		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>Malicious Web sites largely promote the growth of Internet criminal activities and constrain the development of Web services. As a result, there has been strong motivation to develop systemic solution to stopping the user from visiting such Web sites. In this paper, we propose a learning based approach to classifying Web sites into 3 classes: benign, phishing, and malware. Our mechanism only analyzes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) itself without accessing the content of Web sites. Thus, it eliminates the run-time latency and the possibility of exposing users to the browser- based vulnerabilities. By employing learning algorithms, our scheme achieves better performance on generality and cover- age compared with blacklisting service. Through extensive evaluation, the resulting classifiers obtain 95.3% accuracy on detecting malicious Web sites with only 2.5% false positive rate.</p>
